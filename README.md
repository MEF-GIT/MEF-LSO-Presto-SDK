# MEF-LSO-Presto-SDK - Aretha Release

This repository contains the MEF LSO Presto SDK. 

**Note:**
Since Q4 2020 MEF has introduced a common release schema for all SDKs.
The Presto SDK had no progress since last release, this release brings only a new tag.

This release is a significant step towards utilizing programmable
networks as part of our MEF 3.0 vision. The SDK builds on the previous
release to align the API schemas and definitions for Network Resource
Provisioning (NRP) to the LSO Presto NRP IPS which was recently
published as [MEF 60](https://www.mef.net/Assets/Technical_Specifications/PDF/MEF_60.pdf).
In addition, its information model incorporates the latest ONF TAPI 2.0
release. The SDKâ€™s data models are supported in a reference
implementation of the OpenDaylight SDN Controller and will be part of
the official Fluorine release. This reference implementation
demonstrates how a northbound application can, in a technology-agnostic
and vendor-agnostic manner, provision a point-to-point or
point-to-multipoint network connectivity service between end points.
Released Presto APIs are controller and underlay technology-agnostic
thus enabling programmatic network orchestration via various SDN
controllers as well as via proprietary NMS/EMS software.

MEF has leveraged collaborative input from the ONF on its TAPI model in
the creation of the LSO Presto NRP (Network Resource Provisioning) IPS.
CenturyLink, Nokia, Amartus, Ciena, Cisco, Coriant, Ericsson, Huawei,
Infinera, Iometrix, NEC and RAD are among the key contributors of this
release.

The MEF LSO Presto SDK is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Reference Implementations

1) LSO Presto APIs in OpenDaylight SDN Controller

   A reference implementation of the MEF Network Resource Provisioning API is available from the OpenDaylight Unimgr project.

   https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Unimgr:Main

   An instance of the Unimgr project is provided in MEFnet for MEF members to undertake integration testing. Please see the MEFnet Terms of Use.
